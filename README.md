# Email Sender in Node

A professor I do work for wants to provide access to teaching materials, but know who gets such access; also, he wants to send them an automated email to receive it.

Emails are nice because it gives us a higher confidence that that person actually exists; moreover, we can limit it to .edu addresses later if need be.

This is written with nodemailer and served as an express app. There is some basic validation, but this is a POC so it's not really necessary.

Styling/more validation/extra features pending.
